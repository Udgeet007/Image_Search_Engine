Search Functionality: Users can enter keywords in the search bar to find relevant images.
Responsive Design: Built with responsive web design principles, ensuring the search engine works seamlessly across different devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
Image Gallery: A dynamically generated image gallery displays the search results in a grid layout.
Error Handling: User-friendly error messages guide users when no images are found or if an invalid input is given.

3>>Technologies Used:

HTML: Structures the web pages.
CSS: Provides styling, layout, and ensures a responsive design.
